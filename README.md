# Gemini Senpai

*Build your software with AI assistant, collaboratively*


## Overview
Agents (autonomous agents or LLM agents) extend the capability of LLMs by equipping them with tools, which essentially are functions defined to achieve specific tasks. Google's Gemini has introduced support for function calling, much like OpenAI's GPT, allowing the Generative AI models support advanced workflows.

Gemini Senpai is a small, experimental AI assistant prototype built using Gemini's function calling. Currently, Gemini Senpai allows users to generate Python code and small Python applications spanning multiple modules.
