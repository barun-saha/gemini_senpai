Create a file named `students_subjects_marks.csv` and add sample data to it.
There are only three subjects: English, Science, and Maths. Sample data format is as follows:

John,Maths,72
Alice,Maths,87

Next, write a Python program that uses pandas to read the CSV file.
Based on the data, compute and display the average marks of each student.
Also, display the average marks of the students for each subject.
Save all files in the `class_test` dir.
